# SNES PPU Implementation Plan (TDD-Oriented)

## âœ… Phase 1: Core PPU Memory and Register Infrastructure (COMPLETED)

1. **âœ… Write unit tests** for VRAM, CGRAM, and OAM memory access (read/write, edge cases, wraparound)
2. **âœ… Write unit tests** for all PPU register read/write paths, including buffering/latching and address wrap
3. **âœ… Implement** VRAM, CGRAM, OAM as internal arrays
4. **âœ… Implement** all PPU registers ($2100â€“$213F) as member variables
5. **âœ… Implement** register read/write logic with correct side effects and buffering/latching
6. **âœ… Integrate** PPU with system bus for CPU access to registers
7. **âœ… Refactor/expand tests** as new register logic is added

**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED - All 24 tests passing
- VRAM (64KB), CGRAM (512B), OAM (544B) with proper wraparound
- All $2100-$213F registers implemented with correct read/write behavior
- Register buffering/latching (OAM, VRAM, CGRAM address increment)
- Address increment modes and data access patterns
- Integration with system bus for CPU register access

## âœ… Phase 2: Background and Sprite Attribute Handling (COMPLETED)

1. **âœ… Write unit tests** for BG tilemap and attribute table access (BGnSC, BGnNBA, BGMODE, etc.)
2. **âœ… Write unit tests** for OAM attribute parsing, sprite table logic, and CGRAM palette access
3. **âœ… Implement** BG tilemap and attribute table logic
4. **âœ… Implement** OAM attribute parsing and sprite table logic
5. **âœ… Implement** CGRAM palette access and color math stubs
6. **âœ… Refactor/expand tests** for edge cases and integration

**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED - All 24 tests passing
- BG tilemap base calculation (BGnSC registers)
- BG tile data base calculation (BGnNBA registers)
- OAM attribute parsing (Y, X, tile, attributes, X high bits)
- Sprite scanline evaluation with Y wrapping
- Sprite overflow handling (32 sprite limit per scanline)
- CGRAM palette access (15-bit SNES color format)
- Basic background rendering (Mode 0, 2bpp, scrolling)

## ðŸ”„ Phase 3: Rendering Pipeline (Scanline/Frame) (IN PROGRESS)

1. **Write integration tests** for scanline/frame timing, BG/sprite rendering, and priority logic
2. **Implement** scanline and frame timing logic
3. **Implement** BG rendering (modes 0â€“7, tile fetch, scrolling, mosaic, etc.)
4. **Implement** sprite rendering (priority, size, overlap, windowing)
5. **Implement** color math, windowing, and main/sub screen logic
6. **Refactor/expand tests** for rendering edge cases and priority

**Status**: ðŸ”„ READY TO START
- Basic scanline/frame timing implemented
- Mode 0 background rendering stub implemented
- Sprite scanline evaluation implemented
- Need to implement full rendering pipeline with priority logic

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 4: Video Output and Synchronization (PLANNED)

1. **Write tests** for framebuffer output, video timing, and synchronization (mock or headless if needed)
2. **Implement** framebuffer output (256x224, 512x448, RGB888 or similar)
3. **Integrate** with SDL or similar for visual output (optional for headless test)
4. **Synchronize** PPU and CPU timing (scanline, VBLANK, HBLANK)
5. **Refactor/expand tests** for timing and output correctness

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ PLANNED
- Basic framebuffer (256x224) implemented
- PPM export functionality implemented
- Need to implement full video output and CPU synchronization

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 5: Advanced Features and Edge Cases (PLANNED)

1. **Write tests** for Mode 7, windowing, mosaic, color math, and hardware quirks
2. **Implement** Mode 7, windowing, mosaic, and special color math
3. **Implement** open bus, register mirroring, and hardware quirks
4. **Add support** for forced blank, brightness, and display enable/disable
5. **Refactor/expand tests** for advanced features and edge cases

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ PLANNED
- Basic register mirroring implemented
- Need to implement Mode 7, windowing, mosaic, color math

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 6: Comprehensive Test Coverage and CI Integration (PLANNED)

1. **Develop/expand unit and integration tests** for all PPU features
2. **Use known-good ROMs and test patterns** for validation
3. **Add CI integration** for automated PPU test runs
4. **Achieve 100% test coverage** for all implemented PPU logic

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ PLANNED
- 24 comprehensive unit tests implemented and passing
- Need to add integration tests with known-good ROMs
- Need to set up CI integration
