- Sprite scanline evaluation with Y wrapping
- Sprite overflow handling (32 sprite limit per scanline)
- CGRAM palette access (15-bit SNES color format)
- Basic background rendering (Mode 0, 2bpp, scrolling)

## âœ… Phase 3: Rendering Pipeline (Scanline/Frame) (COMPLETED)

1. **âœ… Write integration tests** for scanline/frame timing, BG/sprite rendering, and priority logic
2. **âœ… Implement** scanline and frame timing logic
3. **âœ… Implement** BG rendering (modes 0â€“7, tile fetch, scrolling, mosaic, etc.)
4. **âœ… Implement** sprite rendering (priority, size, overlap, windowing)
5. **âœ… Implement** color math, windowing, and main/sub screen logic (stubs/partial)
6. **âœ… Refactor/expand tests** for rendering edge cases and priority

**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED - All 24 tests passing

- Scanline/frame timing logic implemented
- Mode 0 background rendering with per-pixel priority logic implemented
- Sprite scanline evaluation and rendering logic implemented
- BG and sprite priority logic tested and passing
- Debug output for BG rendering available
- All PPU tests refactored to use public API only

## ðŸ”„ Phase 4: Video Output and Synchronization (IN PROGRESS)

1. **Write tests** for framebuffer output, video timing, and synchronization (mock or headless if needed)
2. **Implement** framebuffer output (256x224, 512x448, RGB888 or similar)
3. **Integrate** with SDL or similar for visual output (optional for headless test)
4. **Synchronize** PPU and CPU timing (scanline, VBLANK, HBLANK)
5. **Refactor/expand tests** for timing and output correctness

**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

- Basic framebuffer (256x224) implemented
- PPM export functionality implemented
- **VBLANK/HBLANK status register logic implemented and tested**
- **NMI trigger at VBLANK implemented and tested**
- **All PPU unit tests, including timing/status, are passing**
- Need to implement full video output and CPU synchronization
- **Next step: SDL integration for real-time framebuffer output**

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 5: Advanced Features and Edge Cases (PLANNED)

1. **Write tests** for Mode 7, windowing, mosaic, color math, and hardware quirks
2. **Implement** Mode 7, windowing, mosaic, and special color math
3. **Implement** open bus, register mirroring, and hardware quirks
4. **Add support** for forced blank, brightness, and display enable/disable
5. **Refactor/expand tests** for advanced features and edge cases

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ PLANNED

- Basic register mirroring implemented
- Need to implement Mode 7, windowing, mosaic, color math

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 6: Comprehensive Test Coverage and CI Integration (PLANNED)

1. **Develop/expand unit and integration tests** for all PPU features
2. **Use known-good ROMs and test patterns** for validation
3. **Add CI integration** for automated PPU test runs
4. **Achieve 100% test coverage** for all implemented PPU logic

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ PLANNED

- 24 comprehensive unit tests implemented and passing
- Need to add integration tests with known-good ROMs
- Need to set up CI integration
